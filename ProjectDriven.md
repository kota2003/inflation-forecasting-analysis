## Living Decision Log — Inflation Prediction and Economic Signal Analysis

> This document records all key design decisions made throughout the project.
> Each entry explains **what** was decided, **why**, and any **alternatives considered**.
> Updated continuously as the project progresses.

## How to Use This Document

- Every non-trivial decision gets an entry here
- Be specific: bad → "chose ARIMA"; good → "chose ARIMA over ETS because..."
- This document is part of the portfolio — it shows analytical thinking

## Phase 0 — Design Decisions

---

### D-001 | Country Selection

**Date:** Phase 0
**Decision:** Use USA, Japan, UK, Germany as main countries. China as supplementary only.

**Rationale:**
- USA: FRED home country; richest data availability; global inflation benchmark
- Japan: Unique 30-year deflation period followed by sudden 2022 inflation reversal;
  BOJ policy as natural experiment; highly relevant for NRI and Japan-focused analysis
- UK: Post-Brexit structural change provides an interesting case of domestically driven
  inflation diverging from EU patterns
- Germany: Largest EU economy; constrained by ECB monetary policy;
  highly exposed to 2022 energy shock

**China (Supplementary):**
Chinese macroeconomic data carries documented reliability concerns:
- GDP figures consistently align with government targets
- CPI basket composition and weighting methodology are not fully transparent
- Official unemployment statistics cover only urban registered workers,
  excluding rural and migrant labour (estimated 300M+ workers)
China is therefore excluded from the main statistical models to preserve
analytical integrity. A descriptive comparison using available NBS/OECD data
is included in the interpretation section with explicit caveats.
This decision reflects data literacy and responsible analysis.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Australia: Relevant given Melbourne base, but adds limited analytical contrast
- France: Possible EU alternative to Germany, but ECB constraint is the same
- India / Brazil: Interesting emerging market contrast, but data gaps too significant

### D-002 | Analysis Period

**Date:** Phase 0
**Decision:** 2000-01 to present (monthly frequency)

**Rationale:**
- Captures three structurally distinct inflation regimes:
  1. 2000–2007: Pre-GFC moderate inflation
  2. 2008–2019: Post-GFC low-inflation, near-deflation era
  3. 2020–present: COVID shock and post-pandemic inflation surge
- Sufficient data length for VAR model stability (T > 200 observations)
- Includes all three named narrative periods (Phillips Curve breakdown, BOJ experiments, 2022 shock)

**Structural Break Points to Test:**
- 2008-09: Global Financial Crisis
- 2020-03: COVID-19 shock
- 2022-02: Energy/inflation shock (Russia-Ukraine, supply chain)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- 1990–present: Longer, but Japan data gaps pre-2000 are problematic
- 2010–present: Too short; misses GFC which is central to Phillips Curve narrative

### D-003 | Data Source Strategy

**Date:** Phase 0
**Decision:** FRED API as primary source via `fredapi` Python library

**Rationale:**
- FRED hosts USA, Japan, UK, and Germany indicators in a single API
- API access ensures reproducibility — no manual CSV downloads
- Demonstrates engineering practice valued by technical employers
- Data quality is equivalent to manual CSV download (same underlying source)
- API keys are free and easy to obtain

**Supplementary Sources:**
- OECD: For indicators not available via FRED (e.g. UK M2, some harmonised series)
- NBS (China): For supplementary China descriptive data only

**API Key Management:**
- Key stored in `.env` file (not tracked by Git)
- `.env.example` provided as template for reproducibility

### D-004 | Model Architecture

**Date:** Phase 0
**Decision:** Three-layer modelling approach: ARIMA → VAR → Ridge Regression

**Layer 1 — ARIMA/SARIMA (Baseline)**
- Univariate inflation forecast per country
- Establishes time-series fundamentals
- Sets accuracy benchmark for comparison
- Demonstrates: stationarity handling, ACF/PACF, model selection

**Layer 2 — VAR (Core Model)**
- Multivariate: CPI + Interest Rate + Unemployment + GDP + M2
- Enables Granger causality testing
- Enables Impulse Response Functions (IRF) → key for Narrative 2
- Enables Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD)
- This layer is the primary analytical contribution of the project

**Layer 3 — Ridge Regression with Lag Features (ML Comparison)**
- Structured feature matrix using engineered lag variables
- Regularisation handles multicollinearity between lagged features
- Feature importance connects to economic interpretation
- Bridges to ML methodology demonstrated in P2

**Alternatives Considered:**
- LSTM / Deep Learning: Covered in P6; intentionally excluded here to avoid overlap
- Prophet: Useful but adds limited economic interpretability
- ARIMAX: Considered, but VAR is more symmetric and enables Granger testing

### D-005 | Train / Test Split Strategy

**Date:** Phase 0
**Decision:** Time-based split — Train: 2000–2019, Test: 2020–present

**Rationale:**
- Time-series data must never use random split (data leakage)
- 2020–present serves as a genuine out-of-sample stress test
- COVID and 2022 shock in the test set makes the evaluation more informative:
  models that fail here can be discussed critically (limitation of historical models)
- ~20 years of training data; ~4-5 years of test data

**No cross-validation:**
- Standard k-fold CV is invalid for time series
- If needed: walk-forward (expanding window) validation in Phase 6
